description: Tutorials to learn old programming languages
---

I love history, especially history of technical topics. But reading the history of programming languages is a bit like the famous quote about dancing about architecture. If you can't see the syntax of a programming language and the types of problems it was being used to solve it can be very hard to understand what exactly what the languages were doing.

To remedy this I've created this compilation of programming tutorials for old school programming languages. I found that once I could see programs written in say, Lisp and Scheme, it was much easier for me to understand the connection between these two languages. This list covers programming languages from the 1950s up to the mid 1970s. I've left C off the list since it's still in wide use and there are an abundance of learning resources for anyone wanting to learn C.

Special shout out to [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRXb5dUK4cvsHbx-rGzSgw) for creating really fantastic, in-depth tutorials for many of the languages on this list. If anyone knows a good tutorial for ALGOL or SNOBOL hit me up @ajcwebdev on Twitter.
