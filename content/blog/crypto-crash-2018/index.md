You may not have been paying much attention to the crypto news churn over the last 6 months and I totally don’t blame you. Since the crash in January the important developments have mostly been technical and legal in nature with all the fun and insanely dumb developments appearing to subside. Many are now wondering if the whole scene is on its way down the memory hole.

I’d recommend Kevin Maney’s interview with Chris Dixon for a considered, long-term analysis of where we are today and what it all means.

TL:DR: The web3 revolution is still tentatively in motion, and there’s reason to hold on to the dream.
Chris Dixon is an investor for the influential Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He placed an ambitious early bet on multiple blockchain projects starting in 2013:

Ripple (April 2013)
Coinbase (December 2013)
OpenBazaar (June 2015)
Despite widespread skepticism among technologists and financial investors a handful of others also took the plunge including:

The Winklevii (April 2013)
Peter Thiel (May 2013)
Tony Gallippi (May 2013)
Jim Breyer (October 2013)
Barry Silbert (March 2014)
Tim Draper (July 2014)
In addition to his early investments, Dixon is also actively engaged with US financial regulators to ensure compliance and contribute to the developing regulatory debate. The vast majority of people jumped into this madness in the last 2 years and really don’t know crap about how any of this works or what it means or where it’s going. This space is inherently unpredictable, but Dixon has had a bird’s-eye view of the entire industry for the last 5 years and has hard won insights about the future trajectory of the industry.

He draws parallels between the 2000 dot-com bubble and the 2018 cryptocurrency bubble.
As a lot of money flowed into the space, some bad actors came in as well… What’s unfortunate is the bad behavior has led some people to think that the whole space is full of bad behavior. I would liken it to the 1990s internet where you did have a lot of bad companies and a lot of nonsense, but you also had Google, Amazon. In the end it was a very, very important technology movement.

Excessive hype built on poorly understood technology incentives bad actors to flood the system all at once. A lot of money has already been lost, and a lot more will likely follow. Many (possibly most) of the 2000 or so active cryptocurrencies will fade into historical footnotes and remain only as harsh financial lessons to gullible investors. But that’s ultimately beside the point. The original dot-com bubble wiped out most of the pre-2000 industry but some companies (Amazon, eBay) recovered and grew far beyond their 2000 peak.

Decentralized applications built on crypto protocols could serve as an alternative approach to the current internet infrastructure
My guess is it’s better to fight the next war than refight the last war. Facebook could continue to be Facebook. Google could continue to be Google, but there will be a whole new set of services built on blockchain. The Big Four might even miss those things and still be incredibly huge companies.

Established platforms will try to adapt, but this will be difficult without completely overhauling their revenue model. Big tech companies are rapidly losing good will from the public. The public’s trust will continue to erode in the absence of drastic reforms to the business of surveillance capitalism.

This option will strongly appeal to the the growing group of depressed former internet optimists. This will challenge the way many internet users think about and interact with the web. If something doesn’t go terribly, terribly wrong (which is always possible) web3 will be a safer and more transparent communication network, instead of the civilization destroying chimera we have on our hands right now.

Nothing is certain. This blog was founded on the aspirational belief that it’s possible to take complete ownership and control over our own data and the algorithms that now run our society. The cultural zeitgeist of the moment understandably has little faith in narrow minded programming nerds fixing a problem they kinda sorta created (despite some talking really loudly about the problem for the past couple decades).

The stakes are high; it doesn’t look like anyone else is planning on building a brand new internet from scratch.
