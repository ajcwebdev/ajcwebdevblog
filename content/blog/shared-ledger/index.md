If you are trying to explain a blockchain to someone totally new to crypto and you use either the words “distributed” or “decentralized” you have already failed.

I don’t mean to say that the average person is ignorant of the terms. Anyone could tell you the literal definition of those words. But just because someone can define the terms “distributed” and “database” separately doesn’t make “distributed database” a useful definition for someone who has never thought about how a database works or why they shouldn’t be centralized.

So if you want to use “distributed database” as your starting point for explaining the blockchain instead of “shared ledger” you better make sure the person you are talking to has a very clear understanding of the implications of distributing a database.

I would guess that the number of people who have contemplated the implications of distributing a database and haven’t heard of blockchain is a pretty low percentage of society.
