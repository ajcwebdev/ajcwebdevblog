12:45, state my assumptions.
1. Mathematics is the language of nature.
2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers.
3. If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge. Therefore, there are patterns everywhere in nature.
-Max Cohen

π is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. It is not a “number” in the sense that most people think of numbers. It doesn’t represent a tangible quantity of something, like a dozen eggs or 365 days. It represents a relationship between ideas, the ideas of “circle,” “circumference,” and “diameter.”

The relationship can be expressed in the form of a fraction (22/7) or decimal (3.14159) representation. But at best this is only an approximation. The digits of π extend to infinity and never repeat. There are still open mathematical questions related to π despite its existence being known for over 2,500 years. The digits of π appear to be randomly distributed, but it has not been proved whether it satisfies a specific kind of statistical randomness. That is to say, is there a pattern to the randomness?

So what about the stock market? The universe of numbers that represents the global economy. Millions of hands at work, billions of minds. A vast network, screaming with life. An organism. A natural organism.

My hypothesis: Within the stock market, there is a pattern as well. Right in front of me, hiding behind the numbers. Always has been.

The 1998 film π starts like all mathematical proofs, by stating its axioms:

Math is the language of nature.
Everything in nature can be represented with numbers.
We can use math to find patterns in the systems of the real world.
Max Cohen is concerned with the patterns in the stock market. Max also suffers from cluster headaches and possibly schizophrenia.

20 years have passed since Darren Aronofsky’s gonzo debut film and today more stock market trades are made by computers using pattern recognition software than by actual humans. Not only did π anticipate the quant takeover of Wall Street, but it also explores a growing strand of belief that Transhumanists and Singularitarians in Silicon Valley have been slowly cultivating over the last two decades.

The guiding philosophy is that advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and molecular engineering will produce emergent and unpredictable forms of superintelligence through some type of intelligence explosion. These intelligences will not only be smarter than humans, they will be all seeing, all knowing, and all powerful. They/it will collect all data, evaluate all conceivable propositions, and through a global interconnected hive-brain will control all necessary physical actuators. Some believe the arrival of such entities could spark a war that results in the death of over a billion people.

So it isn’t surprising that Max’s discovery of the hidden code of the universe triggers the alarm bells of both ancient Arithmancist cults and Wall Street funds.

Another prescient detail of the film is the parallel between the complexity of the stock market and the board game Go. Since the birth of computing there has been a rich tradition of computers categorically defeating humans in games like chess, tic-tac-toe, checkers, and backgammon. But Go is different, or so it was thought.

There are more possible moves in the game of Go than atoms in the universe. This is important when trying to program a computer to play a game. If the computer can compute all possible future moves and their expected values, they can always choose the optimal move. But if there are more moves than there is time for the computer to compute the moves, then it needs to develop heuristics to make a move.

In 2016, 9 dan Go player Lee Sedol was defeated 1-4 by DeepMind’s AlphaGo. AlphaGo is a neural network that was trained with reinforcement learning to develop its strategic intuition. It first observed thousands of games from human players to identify and analyze patterns of moves. A more recent and powerful version, AlphaZero, learns entirely through self-play.

If a game as complex as Go can be conquered by an algorithm how much more difficult will it be for an algorithm to conquer the complexity of the stock market? What about the complexity of God?

The history of math has a disturbing streak of visionaries who eventually went insane. Galois published all of his mathematical writings from prison after having murder his aunt, uncle, and brother. Throughout his life he explained the episode in a very matter-of-fact way. There was a history of mental illness in his family, and since he was a proud eugenicist he saw it as his duty to the human race to remove them from the gene pool. Godel, Cantor, Boltzmann, and Turing all studied similar mathematical theories of infinity and all experienced various symptoms of mental illness. Cantor died in an insane asylum, Godel slowly starved himself to death for fear of poisoning, and Boltzmann and Turing both committed suicide. But a mathematician would tell us to be wary of small sample sizes. These men all suffered varying degrees of personal tragedies, social ostracisation, and skepticism of their groundbreaking work, which likely contributed to their states of minds.

Throughout the film Max hovers at the edge of madness. By the end of the film it’s unclear how much, if any, of the main storyline is real or just a hallucination. Is the bottleneck to discovering the master algorithm not intelligence, but sanity?
