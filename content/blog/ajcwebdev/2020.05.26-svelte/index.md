*Many moon's ago, the wisest of the JavaScript elders came down from the mountain and said, "I have created jQuery!" And the villagers said, "Jake Weary? The actor from Zombeavers?" And Elder Resig, for it was he, said, "No it is not a man! It is magic! With these spells we shall tame the capricious Browser Gods and bend them to our will.”*

*And the villagers rejoiced for the Browser God’s were indeed capricious and cruel and visited much misery upon their lands. And they re-plowed their fields with the new magic. At the time of the next coat harvest all agreed that the fruits of their labor’s tasted sweet and AJAX-y. And there were conferences and t-shirts and other assorted merchandise. And that was the end of the first JavaScript era.*

*The tide came and went. The moon rose and fell. Years passed and while jQuery was still the dominant religion there were some who grew fearful that it was not powerful enough for the elaborate designs of the modern age. Then one day a traveler came from the Western lands of Zuckerbergia and said:*

*“Hear me! For I bring a message of great importance! You’re all doing it wrong! These primitive incantations do not befit our modern age of science and technology! Look at these wretched structures you have built! I would not step inside for fear of my safety! At Zuckerbergia we build not these mud huts but magnificent towers that reach the very heavens! And we do it not with magic, but with machines. Come! Let me show you.”*

*And the villagers looked upon the machines and they liked not what they saw. The traveler was cast out as a heretic. And yet, some felt that these machines could perhaps help to meet their own ambitions. And the heretics grew in number until a heresy became the new orthodoxy and the land was covered in machines. And that was the second era of JavaScript.

## Compilation

Svelte is a frontend JavaScript framework created by Rich Harris on November 15, 2016. Like the big three web frameworks (Angular, React, Vue) it helps developers create components that combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Unlike the previous frameworks, it contains an additional compiler that compiles your final code before deploying to the web or cloud. This additional compile step makes websites and app created with Svelte significantly smaller than those created by other popular frameworks.

## Magical Disappearing Framework

Over Svelte's history the project has had difficulty articulating its design decisions and benefits. The description on the project's first commit called it **"the frameworkless UI framework."** Around 2018 it was being called, **“the magical disappearing UI framework.”** And in 2020 it's now known for creating **"cybernetically enhanced web apps."** I think we're moving backwards here, you may have just been 4 years ahead of the zeitgeist. I would recommend giving frameworkless UI another try, but replace UI with frontend, **the frameworkless frontend**.
