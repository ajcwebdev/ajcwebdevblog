## `db_size`
* Number of bytes contained in the database
* Includes all table and index data on disk, including database bloat

## `tables`
* Number of tables in the database

## `active-connections`
* Number of connections established on the database

## `current_transaction`
* Current transaction ID
* Can be used to track writes over time

## `index-cache-hit-rate`
* Ratio of index lookups served from shared buffer cache, rounded to five decimal points
* Heroku recommends a value of 0.99 or greater if possible
* If your index hit rate is consistently less than 0.99, you should investigate your Expensive Queries or you may need to upgrade your database plan for more RAM

## `table-cache-hit-rate`
* Ratio of table lookups served from shared buffer cache, rounded to five decimal points
* Heroku recommends a value of 0.99 or greater if possible
* If your table hit rate is consistently less than 0.99, you may need to upgrade your database plan for more RAM

## `waiting-connections`
* Number of connections waiting on a lock to be acquired
* If many connections are waiting, this can be a sign of mishandled database concurrency

## `memory-postgres`
* Approximate amount of memory used by your databaseâ€™s Postgres processes in kB
* Includes shared buffer cache as well as memory for each connection

## `follower-lag-commits`
* Replication lag, measured as the number of commits that this follower is behind its leader
* Replication is asynchronous so a number greater than zero may not indicate an issue, however an increasing value deserves investigation
* This metric is only published for follower databases
