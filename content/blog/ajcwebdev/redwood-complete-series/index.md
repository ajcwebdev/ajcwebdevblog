# Introduction

## Redwood Philosophies

RedwoodJS is an opinionated, full-stack, serverless web application framework for the Jamstack. It is designed to enable the dream of a Universal Deployment Machine.

## Full Stack React

There has recently been a sudden influx of different projects aiming to build a ***Full Stack React*** framework. What are people talking about when they say Full Stack React and why is it suddenly such a hot topic?

## Jamstack

The Jamstack is a departure from traditional server-rendered stacks like LAMP and MEAN. Jamstack applications serve static files from globally distributed CDN's, removing the server and the database from the stack entirely and replacing them with APIs that provide dynamic functionality.

## Serverless

Serverless is a made up buzz word that is also commonly used to refer to Function-as-a-Service cloud products like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). Instead of paying for a server to always be running and ready to accept requests, you pay based on the specific number of function calls your app invokes.

# Tutorial

## Part 1 - Setup

We'll install and create our first Redwood application. 

## Part 2 - Routes

We'll take a look at Redwood's router and create links for the pages we created.

## Part 3 - Prisma

We'll get our database up and running and learn to create, retrieve, update, and destroy blog posts.

## Part 4 - CRUD

We'll look at all the code that was generated that allowed us to perform our CRUD operations on the blog posts. We'll also set up our frontend to query data from our backend to render a list of our blog posts to the front page.

## Part 5 - Contact

We'll be combining everything we've learned up to this point to generate a contact page and take input from a user.

## Part 6 - GraphQL

We'll connect our contact form to our database so we can persistent the data entered into the form.

## Part 7 - Deploy

We'll deploy our frontend application with Serverless functions on Netlify and we'll deploy our backend to a hosted Postgres database on Heroku.

## Part 8 - Auth

We'll implement role-based authentication with Netlify Identity.
