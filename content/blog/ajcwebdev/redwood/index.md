>*Full stack web application development is the next evolution of JAMstack. That becomes a primary place that you would deploy a full stack web application, and thatâ€™s what RedwoodJS is about.*

Redwood is an opinionated, full-stack, serverless web application framework for building and deploying JAMstack applications. Imagine:

* React frontend

* Statically delivered by CDN

* Talking via GraphQL to backend

* Backend running on AWS Lambdas

* All deployable with `git` push

## Redwood Philosophies

#### There is power in standards about which tech to use, how to organize code into files, and how to name things

#### Relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL are still the workhorses of today's web apps

#### Operate in a serverless mindset and deploy to a generic computational grid

#### To deploy your application, you should only need to commit and push to your Git repository

#### To scale from zero to thousands of users should not require your intervention

#### Useful for writing simple, toy applications and complex, mission-critical applications

#### JavaScript can be the primary language on both frontend and backend

## Universal Deployment Machine

>*My dream of a future is for something I call a universal deployment machine, which means I write my code. It's all text. I just write text. Then I commit to GitHub. Then it's picked up and it's deployed into reality. That's it. That's the whole thing. That's what I want. That's what I've been looking for.*
