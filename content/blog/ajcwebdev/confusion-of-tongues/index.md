Linguistic software designed to translate text or speech from one language to another is referred to as machine translation.

The most basic type of translation is a literal, word-to-word translation, also called metaphrase. This process substitutes individual words in the source language for corresponding words in the target language. This leads to poor translations since the associations between human languages are too complex for a direct one-to-one mapping of terms.

A successful machine translation system will:

* Recognize whole phrases and their closest counterparts in the target language.
* Parse the grammatical structures of each languages’ syntax.
* Weigh conflicting interpretations stemming from the indeterminate nature of semantics and meaning.
* Balance poetic embellishments with plain style explanation.
* Strive to maximize fidelity, clarity, and elegance.

## Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta
The Sumerian myth of Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta is one of the earliest known examples of the confusion of tongues myth. It is estimated that the account was composed in the Neo-Sumerian period around the 21st century BC.

Enmerkar demands a tribute of precious materials from Aratta to fund the construction of his ziggurat. He threatens to destroy Aratta and disperse its people if they do not send him the tribute. He recites “Incantation of Nudimmud“, a hymn imploring Enki to restore the linguistic unity of the inhabited regions.

## Tower of Babel

The Tower of Babel (Genesis 11) is an origin myth about why the world’s peoples speak different languages. After the Great Flood humanity is united and migrating eastward to Shinar. They agree to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven. God, observing their city and tower, confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other, and scatters them around the world.

> And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one,  
> and they have all one language; and this they begin to do:  
> and now nothing will be restrained from them,  
> which they have imagined to do.  
>
> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language,  
> that they may not understand one another’s speech.  
>
> So the LORD scattered them abroad  
> from thence upon the face of all the earth:  
> and they left off to build the city.  

The original derivation of the name Babel is uncertain. The native Akkadian name of Babylon was Bāb-ilim, meaning “gate of God”. This may be the result of Akkadian folk etymology applied to an earlier form from a non-Semitic language, Babilla. The Bible states that “Babel” is from the Hebrew verb to jumble or confuse, bālal.

Some scholars associate the Tower of Babel with the Etemenanki, or “Temple of the Foundation of Heaven and Earth”. The king of Babylonia dedicated the 300-ft ziggurat to the Mesopotamian god Marduk (son of Enki) in 610 BCE.

![Marduk son of Enki](marduk.jpeg)

Ziggurat means “to build on a raised area.” It has the form of a terraced compound of successively receding stories or levels. Other notable ziggurats include the Great Ziggurat of Ur and the Ziggurat of Aqar Quf. The Etemenanki was rebuilt by the 6th-century BCE Neo-Babylonian rulers Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar II. Some scholars believe the story was created during the Babylonian captivity of the Hebrews.

> *A former king built the Temple of the Seven Lights of the Earth, but he did not complete its head. Since a remote time, people had abandoned it, without order expressing their words. Since that time earthquakes and lightning had dispersed its sun-dried clay; the bricks of the casing had split, and the earth of the interior had been scattered in heaps.*
>
>***Nebuchadnezzar (605 – 562)***

Scholars discovered the oldest known representation of the Etemenanki carved on a black stone in the Schøyen Collection. The Tower of Babel Stele dates from 604–562 BCE, the time of Nebuchadnezzar II. Herodotus referred to the ziggurat as the Temple of Zeus Belus in 440 BCE.

Alexander the Great ordered the demolition of the decaying ziggurat in 331 BCE in preparation for a reconstruction. He managed to move the tiles of the tower to another location but his death stopped the reconstruction.

## Forbidden Experiment

Psamtik I ruled as Pharaoh of Egypt (664-610 BCE) establishing the 139 year reign of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. The second volume of Herodotus’ Histories includes a story he heard about the leader on his travel through Egypt around 454 BC. Psamtik wanted to determine the oldest nation and establish the world’s original language. He sought to discover the origin of language by conducting an experiment with two children.

Two newborn babies are given to a shepherd. No one is allowed to speak to them. The shepherd feeds and cares for them while listening to determine their first words. The hypothesis was that the first word would be uttered in the root language of all people. And if that root language just happens to be the official language of your empire then all the better.

One of the children cries "βεκός" (bekós) similar to the sound of the Phrygian word for bread. Thus, it is concluded that the Phrygians were an older people than the Egyptians, and that Phrygian was the original language of men. There are of course many reasons to doubt the validity of this story.

![Pharaoh Psamtik I](Psamtik.jpeg)

Surprisingly, this experiment reappears multiple times throughout history, and usually contains a similar amalgamation of linguistics, politics, and religion.

Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (1194-1250) heavily promoted literature and spoke six languages. This came in handy since he was four kings at once (Sicily, Germany, Italy, Jerusalem). And since he also acquired control of Jerusalem during the Crusades we can see why he would become intrigued by the forbidden experiment and its theological implications. It is believed that he was seeking to discover what language would have been imparted unto Adam and Eve by God.

The experiments were recorded by the Franciscan friar Salimbene di Adam (1221-1290) in his Chronicles:

> *Frederick encouraged foster-mothers and nurses to suckle and bathe and wash the children, but in no ways to prattle or speak with them; for he would have learnt whether they would speak the Hebrew language (which he took to have been the first), or Greek, or Latin, or Arabic, or perchance the tongue of their parents of whom they had been born. But he laboured in vain, for the children could not live without clappings of the hands, and gestures, and gladness of countenance, and blandishments.*

James IV of Scotland (1473-1513) was also an educated polyglot and may have performed the experiment to determine if language was learned or innate. He sent two children to be raised by a mute woman on the isolated island of Inchkeith. The children were reported to have spoken good Hebrew. Historians were skeptical of these claims soon after they were made.

Mughal emperor Akbar (1542-1605) held that speech arose from hearing, thus children raised without hearing human speech would become mute. To defend this stance he had children raised in isolation. They were not allowed to be spoken to and as they grew older they remained mute.

## Cratylus

In Plato’s dialogue Cratylus, Socrates is asked whether names are “conventional” or “natural.” The subject is the correctness of names. Is language a system of arbitrary signs or do words intrinsically relate to the things they signify?

Hermogenes argues that names have come about due to custom and convention. They do not express the essence of their subject, so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them.

Socrates makes guesses at Hermogenes’ request as to where names and words have come from. These include the names of the Olympian gods, personified deities, and many words that describe abstract concepts. He examines whether, for example, giving names of “streams” to Cronus and Rhea (Ροή– flow or space) are purely accidental.

> *Don’t you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names “Rhea” and “Cronus” had the same thought as Heracleitus? Do you think he gave both of them the names of streams merely by chance?*

The Greek term “ῥεῦμα” may refer to the flow of any medium and is not restricted to the flow of water or liquids. Many of the words which Socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name, but have changed over time. Those of which he cannot find a link, he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word.

> *Names have been so twisted in all manner of ways, that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue.*

Cratylus, a disciple of Heraclitus, believes that names arrive from divine origins, making them necessarily correct. Socrates cites imperfections of certain names in capturing the objects they seek to signify. Socrates thus rejects the study of language as philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves.

Socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist. A name (onoma) relates to its subject. Like a painter using color to express the essence of his subject. The creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word’s subject.

> *The best possible way to speak consists in using names all (or most) of which are like the things they name (that is, are appropriate to them), while the worst is to use the opposite kind of names.*

The phonological characteristics of a language will make certain sounds better suited for soft things, liquids, sharp objects, etc. Socrates’s statement that words are not musical imitations of the nature suggests that Plato didn’t believe that language itself generates from sound words.

Plato also inserts his theory of forms into the dialogue. For example, no matter what a hammer is made out of, it is still called a “hammer”, and thus is the form of a hammer. Cratylus concedes the existence of a form, “beautiful itself, and a good itself, and the same for each one of the things that are.”

> *So mustn’t a rule-setter also know how to embody in sounds and syllables the name naturally suited to each thing? And if he is to be an authentic giver of names, mustn’t he, in making and giving each name, look to what a name itself is? And if different rule-setters do not make each name out of the same syllables, we mustn’t forget that different blacksmiths, who are making the same tool for the same type of work, don’t all make it out of the same iron. But as long as they give it the same form–even if that form is embodied in different iron–the tool will be correct, whether it is made in Greece or abroad. Isn’t that so?*

## Zairja

A zairja was a device used by medieval Arab astrologers to generate ideas by mechanical means. The name may derive from a mixture of the Persian words zaicha (horoscope; astronomical table) and daira (circle). It works from an agreement in the wording of question and answer, with the help of the technique of “breaking down.” It was supposed that new paths of insight and thought could be created by combining number values associated with the letters and categories. Its exact origin, design, and operations are a matter of historical debate.

![Zairja](zairja.jpeg)

> *A branch of the science of letter magic is the technique of finding out answers from questions by means of connections existing between the letters of the expressions used in the question. Authorities on letter magic imagine that these connections can form the basis for knowing the future happenings they want to know.*
>
>***Ibn Khaldun (Muqaddimah, 1377)***

Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) was introduced to the device in 1370 and described it in his universal history Muqaddimah in 1377. Its owner, Al-Marjānī, claimed it was a traditional artifact based on an ancient science, although we don’t seem to have evidence of the machine prior to the 14th century. One possible interpretation is that the device was inspired by the unique concurrent historical influences of algebra and astrology on medieval Islam.

Algebra was developed by Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (780-850) around 820. He adopted the Hindu–Arabic numeral system invented by Indian mathematicians between the 1st and 4th century, including base 10 notation and decimal arithmetic. His technique of performing basic arithmetic by applying a set of memorized rules on place values was called algorism. The term algorism morphed into algorithm after later scholars confused the term with the Greek arithmetic.

Abu Ma’shar’s (787-886) influential treatise Introductorium in Astronomiam lead to Astrology’s rise in prominence in the Muslim world as the 9th century progressed. Desert travelers at night relied upon knowledge of the constellations for guidance in their journeys. Muslims also needed to determine the time of their prayers and the correct orientation of their mosques.

During the Islamic Golden Age astronomers of the 10th and 11th century were highly critical of the idea that heavenly bodies were influential upon terrestrial affairs as well as the human condition. Advances in astronomical data collection motivated Islamic astronomers to grapple with the epistemological problems of Ptolemy’s geocentric model that Copernicus, Brahe, and Galileo would discover hundreds of years later. They achieved this through meticulous empirical observations of astronomical data.

This would make the zairja a relic of the Middle Eastern transition from divination and numerology to a more rigorous quantitative and deductive method of measurement and experimentation that anticipates many of the philosophical stances of Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, and Liebniz in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Just as alchemy provided a primitive prototype for empirical chemistry experiments in the West, the zairja’s inventors sought to reconcile the capricious predictive power of the oracle with the mechanical certainty of calculating machines. This is my own pet theory and should not be viewed as anything beyond wild speculation. Actual scholars are still actively investigating the zairja’s design and historical relevance.

Khaldun attributed a pseudo-graphical work to as-Sabti called “Za’irajah of the World.” The description evokes operating instructions in lines of verse:

> *Select a star rise. Figure out its signs.*  
> *Reverse its root. Straighten it out with the cycle.*  
> *Someone will perceive those things. He will achieve his purpose*  
> *And be given their letters in whose arrangement the evidence lies.*  

## Ars magna

It has been suggested that Catalan–Majorcan mystic Ramon Llull (1232-1315) became familiar with the zairja in his travels and studies of Arab culture. He may have used it as a prototype for his Ars magna after observing Arab astrologers use it.

![Ars magna](ars-magna.jpeg)

The Ars magna operated by combining religious and philosophical attributes selected from a number of lists. His first description was in 1290 in The Abbreviated Art of Finding Truth. He revised his ideas in 1305 in the Ars generalis ultima or Ars magna (“The Ultimate General Art” or “The Great Art”).

The Art was intended as a debating tool for winning Muslims to the Christian faith through logic and reason. Through his detailed analytical efforts, Llull built an in-depth theosophic reference by which a reader could enter any argument or question. The reader used visual aids and a book of charts to combine various ideas. The machine would generate statements which came together to form an answer.

Some computer scientists have adopted Llull as a sort of founding father, claiming that his system of logic was the beginning of information science.

In 1726, Jonathan Swift envisaged a fictional device based on the Ars magna that generates permutations of word sets. It is one of the earliest known reference to a device resembling a modern computer.

> *Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.*

> *The superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but some larger than others. They were all linked together by slender wires. These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without any order.*  
>
> *The professor then desired me “to observe; for he was going to set his engine at work.” The pupils, at his command, took each of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed.*  
>
> *He then commanded six-and-thirty of the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were scribes. This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn, the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as the square bits of wood moved upside down.*
