Blitz.js is a fullstack React framework built on Next.js and inspired by Ruby on Rails. Blitz is designed for tiny to large database-backed applications that have one or more graphical user interfaces. While it currently only supports web, it is pursuing the dream of a single monolithic application that runs on web and mobile with maximum code sharing and minimal boilerplate.

## Foundational Principles

#### Fullstack & Monolithic
Fullstack, monolithic applications are simpler than applications with separate frontend and backends.

*Monolithic doesn't mean it will be slow or hard to scale to large teams. Monolithic doesn't mean there isn't separation of concerns. Monolithic means you can reason about your app as a single entity.*

#### API Not Required
Doesn't require you to have a REST or GraphQL API.

*Blitz is a framework for the 99% of us at companies with <100 employees. The vast majority of these apps don't actually need an API, at least not until years down the road when you have the time and resources to build one.*

#### Convention over Configuration
Make as many decisions and do as much work for you as possible. Common project structure and architectural patterns for easy transitioning between projects.

*Convention over configuration doesn't mean no configuration. It means configuration is optional. Blitz will provide all the escape hatches you need for bespoke customization.*

#### Loose Opinions
Conventional file structure but rarely enforced. When the community hasn't reached consensus you are prompted to choose.

*Blitz is opinionated. The out-of-the-box experience guides you on a path perfect for most applications. However, Blitz isn't arrogant. It understands there are very good reasons for deviating from convention, and it allows you to do so.*

#### Easy to Start, Easy to Scale
Focus on scaling in all forms including lines of code, number of people working in the codebase, and code execution.

*A framework that's only easy for one end of an application lifecycle is not a good framework. Both starting and scaling must be easy.*

#### Stability
Follow a public RFC (request for comments) process so all users and companies can propose and evaluate new features.

*A stable release cycle ensures minimal breaking changes, and it ensures you know exactly what and when a breaking change will occur. It also minimizes bugs in stable releases by ensuring features are in beta for a minimum amount of time. Ember is the model citizen in this regard.*

#### Community over Code
Comprehensive Code of Conduct. LGBTQ+, women, and minorities are especially welcome.

*We are all in this together, from the youngest to the oldest. We are all more similar than we are different. We can and should solve problems together. We should learn from other communities, not compete against them.*
