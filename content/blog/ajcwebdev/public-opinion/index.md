# Straw Poll

In 1824, the Harrisburg Pennsylvanian newspaper conducted the [first presidential preference poll in the nation's history](https://www.fandm.edu/uploads/files/271296109834777015-the-first-political-poll-6-18-2002.pdf) in Wilmington, Delaware. The results were said to be reported *without discrimination of findings*, which is to say *reported accurately*.

Andrew Jackson dominated the poll with 70% of the vote (n=335) against Secretary of State John Quincy Adams at 23%. These surveys were known as "straw polls" and did not employ proper sampling methods to assess probability. This culminated in 1936 when the Literary Digest incorrectly predicted Alf Landon over Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt won 46 out of 48 states and 63% of the popular vote.

>*There is a common impression that public opinion depends upon and is measured by the mere number of persons to be found on each side of a question; but this is far from accurate.*
>
>*If forty-nine percent of a community feel very strongly on one side, and fifty-one percent are lukewarmly on the other, the former opinion has the greater public force behind it. The ideas of people who possess the greatest knowledge of a subject are also of more weight than those of an equal number of ignorant persons.*

This failure was attributed to the self-selection process employed by the pollsters. Some responded to the questionnaire while most did not, and the mailings were only delivered to individuals with auto registrations and telephone listings, excluding millions of poor Roosevelt supporters. Unfortunately Nate Silver wasn’t around at the time, but many did vie to be that era’s official oracle.

# Public Opinion

In 1922, Walter Lippmann published *Public Opinion*, an attempt to reconcile the tension between functional democratic government and irrational public perceptions. Lippmann believed that you had to separate an event into three categories: the event itself, our impression of the event, and our reaction to our impression of the event.

>*The analyst of public opinion must begin by recognizing the triangular relationship between:*
>* *the scene of action*
>* *the human picture of that scene*
>* *the human response to that picture working itself out upon the scene of action*
>
>*It is like a play suggested to the actors by their own experience, in which the plot is transacted in the real lives of the actors, and not merely in their stage parts. The moving picture often emphasizes with great skill this double drama of interior motive and external behavior.*

The events are objective, but it is our subjective impression of the events that he terms “public affairs.” Our emotional sentiment of that impression is then termed “public opinion.”

>*Those features of the world outside which have to do with the behavior of other human beings, in so far as that behavior crosses ours, is dependent upon us, or is interesting to us, we call roughly public affairs. The pictures inside the heads of these human beings, the pictures of themselves, of others, of their needs, purposes, and relationship, are their public opinions.*
>
>*Those pictures which are acted upon by groups of people, or by individuals acting in the name of groups, are Public Opinion with capital letters.*

Lippmann lists what he considers the chief factors limiting our access to facts:

* Artificial censorships
* Limitations of social contact
* Meager daily time for paying attention to public affairs
* Distortions arising from compressing events into very short messages
* Difficulty of expressing a complicated world with a small vocabulary
* Fear of facing facts that threaten the established routine of men's lives

# Public Survey

In 1926, Archibald M. Crossley started conducting surveys of radio audiences to measure the intensity of emotion they expressed on various issues. Nine years later he began to compete with George Gallup to predict the 1936 presidential election. In 1935, Gallup Poll published its first release of public opinion data, aiming to provide "[scientific, nonpartisan assessment of American public opinion](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/169682/years-ago-first-gallup-poll.aspx)." The Oxford University Press established the academic journal Public Opinion Quarterly in 1937.

>*The term public opinion is given its meaning with reference to a multi-individual situation in which individuals are expressing themselves, or can be called upon to express themselves, as favoring or supporting (or else disfavoring or opposing) some definite condition, person, or proposal of widespread importance, in such a proportion of number, intensity, and constancy, as to give rise to the probability of affecting action, directly or indirectly, toward the object concerned.*
>
>*Granting that indices of collective alignments of "public opinion" in a social field could be developed there is still good reason for us to continue our emphasis upon measurement at the more elementary level, namely, the behaviors of individuals.*
>
>***Floyd H. Allport***  
>***Toward a Science of Public Opinion, 1937***

In Gauging Public Opinion (1944), Hadley Cantril said the field of public opinion research had been transformed from “an academic hobby and commercial toy to a discipline of its own.”

>*The dizzy speed with which this development took place left the social scientist momentarily breathless. Vaguely he sensed that something important was happening in a domain he had come to regard as his own. Sometimes his irritation led him to a type of superior criticism that did little credit to his sense of objectivity.*
