Today in the United States we have somewhere close to four or five thousand data points on every individual. So we model the personality of every adult across the United States, some 230 million people.
Alexander Nix
CEO Cambridge Analytica
October 2016

The connectivity that is the heart of globalisation can be exploited by states with hostile intent to further their aims. The risks at stake are profound and represent a fundamental threat to our sovereignty.
Alex Younger
Head of MI6
December 2016

It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.

I made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool.

Cambridge Analytica Data Scientist

Cambridge Analytica was created in 2013 as an offshoot of its British parent company SCL Group to participate in American politics. The company is partly owned by American hedge-fund quant Robert Mercer. The firm maintains offices in London, New York City, and Washington D.C.

According to SCL Group’s website:

SCL Group provides data, analytics and strategy to governments and military organizations worldwide. For over 25 years, we have conducted behavioral change programs in over 60 countries & have been formally recognized for our work in defense & social change.

Cambridge Analytica’s website is even more succinct:

Cambridge Analytica uses data to change audience behavior.


Cambridge Analytica was involved in 44 US political races in 2014
Ted Cruz hired Cambridge Analytica in 2015. In 2016, CA worked for Donald Trump’s campaign and on the Leave.EU campaign. CA’s role in those campaigns is the subject of ongoing criminal investigations in the US and the UK.

On March 17, 2018, The New York Times and the Observer reported on Cambridge Analytica’s use of personal information acquired by an external researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, who claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. In response, Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from advertising on its platform.

Facebook has scheduled an open meeting to all employees on March 20, 2018 to let them ask questions. The meeting will be led by Paul Grewal, the company’s deputy general counsel. Grewal will address the use of as many as 50 million user profiles by Cambridge Analytica as part of its ad targeting efforts during the 2016 election.

Both The New York Times and The Observer called this a data “breach.” Facebook said that it is not a breach.
