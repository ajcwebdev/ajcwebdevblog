The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.
Edward Bernays, 1928

The Cambridge Analytica/Facebook controversy has propelled data security into the national consciousness at a scale we haven’t seen since the Snowden global surveillance disclosures. Personal data security is a technical and politically fraught topic that most people would prefer to ignore. They are content letting academics and programmers debate these issues to death while assuming the platforms they use are just fine. Zuckerberg would never allow these kinds of shenanigans on my social network!

But the topic has monopolized the public’s attention. Data breaches have been commonplace for years, and it’s not obvious what exactly is different this time. I think the difference is that this particular story clearly illustrates the ways in which digital advertising, political campaigns, and military grade psychological warfare have become almost indistinguishable from each other. Welcome to the information age, I guess?

Let me be very clear about my point here. I don’t mean to connect these topics in a lizard-people-deep-state conspiracy way. There isn’t a small group of people using computers to control the minds of billions of people. But there is a clear and undeniable conceptual connection between the goals, methods and tools used for selling ads, electing candidates, and overthrowing banana republics. They say that data and AI are the new oil and electricity, but they might also be the new gunpowder.

Marketers, politicians, and generals all want to achieve the same goal: influence a person’s belief with the goal of influencing their behavior. It doesn’t matter whether that behavior involves purchasing, voting, or revolutionizing. Once you have changed a person’s mind, their behavior will follow.

Steven Bannon follows this idea of the Breitbart Doctrine: If you want to change politics you first have to change culture, because politics flows from culture. I said if you want to change culture, you have to first understand what the units of culture are. People are the units of culture. If you want to change politics, you first have to change people to change the culture.
Christopher Wylie, Cambridge Analytica Data Scientist

All three of these fields are now fundamentally data science problems
Data science follows a simple process:

Data collection
Data analysis
Make decisions informed by analysis
Evaluate effect of decisions and gather more/different data
This process can improve warehouse efficiency or microchip energy usage. But once you try to apply this process to people you immediately find yourself in a quagmire of ethical issues. Machine learning uses optimization algorithms on large data sets to maximize or minimize a specific metric. This is wonderful if the metric is the energy efficiency in a server farm and you apply gradient descent to increase efficiency.

But what if your metric is to optimize a person’s animosity towards immigrants or skepticism towards vaccines? What if your system reward hacks its way to these metrics when you aren’t looking?

Data collection takes in massive amounts of personal data on their targets through social media apps. That data can be analyzed to discover your cognitive biases and beliefs. They use this analysis to create an information stream that targets your psychology and influences your behavior. Finally they evaluate the process and gather more data. At no point are the subjects given the opportunity to consent or even comprehend this process.

But people fooled by this are just dumb, right?
No one wants to think that they are susceptible to this kind of manipulation. If it were this easy to hijack a person’s beliefs it would take away our core autonomy in a really scary way. It’s crucial to note that the jury is still out on whether any of this works at all. It will continue to be a black box as long as the largest data sets and models are proprietarily owned by a small handful of corporations. This has created a reproducibility crisis in AI that mirrors the recent crisis in psychology.

We are still arguing about what data is important, how to gain insight from the data, and how to use those insights to inform decision making. Every company in the world is scrambling to master this process so they can claim their pot of gold at the end of the algorithm rainbow. If analytics already had a kind of godlike omniscience Robert Mercer would have just elected himself president.

Every major CEO of every major company is bullish on AI. Everyone is chasing the nugget of gold.
Vipin Mayar, head of Fidelity’s AI initiatives

We should be extremely skeptical of the idea that Cambridge Analytica built a revolutionary mind control machine. This story could easily blow up in the press’s face if CA’s systems are shown to be something like a second rate version of IBM’s Watson. CA have made claims that they ran the entire digital campaign for Trump and also that their data wasn’t used at all. CA wants to be seen as effective when selling their business and ineffective when lawmakers and the public express outrage.

Behavioral Economics
Behavioral economists have been studying this topic for decades. Researchers like Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler make some interesting arguments to support their idea that almost anyone is susceptible to certain kinds of “nudges.” You may find your own faulty thought processes reflected back at you in their studies. If not you might be a Vulcan.

These studies have already been canonized by many but they should not be taken as gospel. Big data enabled social science is a very new and volatile field. It will continue to evolve in unexpected ways as we create larger and more detailed data sets collected with devices that record larger and more diverse types of data. This is exactly why the use of personal data needs to be approached with an incredibly high degree of thoroughness and scrutiny. These two qualities are quickly sacrificed with the maxim “Move fast and break things.”

Behavior economics is relevant now because it provides a way to frame these issues of bias and manipulation. In the past we hid behind the notion of Homo economicus instead of reckoning with the messiness of human decision making. Behavior economics gives us a more empirical way of asking to what degree large scale behavior modification tools can be used to shape public opinion.

No one knows how any of these systems truly impact society and culture because nothing like these systems have ever existed before. Con men and propagandists are as old as time but the speed and scale of their delivery mechanism has profoundly changed the landscape.
