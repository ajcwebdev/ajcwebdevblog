<p>In 1983, David Chaum designed ecash as an anonymous cryptographic electronic money.</p>
<h2>Blind Signatures</h2>
<p>In 1982, Chaum introduced blind signatures, hoping to ensure the complete privacy of users conducting online transactions. Chaum was concerned with the public nature and open access to online payments and personal information. He proposed a system of cryptographic protocols ensuring untraceable personal payments online. It was used as a micropayment system at one US bank from 1995 to 1998.</p>
<p>Software on the user’s computer stored money in a digital format, cryptographically signed by a bank. The user could spend the digital money at any shop accepting eCash. They would not need to open an account with the vendor first or transmitting credit card numbers.</p>
<p>Security was ensured by public key digital signature schemes. The RSA blind signatures achieved unlinkability between withdrawal and spend transactions. Depending on the payment transactions, one distinguishes between on-line and off-line electronic cash</p>
<p>If the payee has to contact a third party before accepting a payment, the system is called an on-line system</p>
<p>DigiCash required user software that withdrew notes from a bank and then designated specific encrypted keys before sending the money to a recipient. This allowed electronic payments to become untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or a third party This improved security through the issuance of secured keys which prevented third parties from accessing personal information.</p>
<h2>DigiCash Inc.</h2>
<p>DigiCash was an electronic money corporation founded by Chaum in 1989. Chaum started the company with “ecash” as its trademark. He raised $10 million from David Marquardt and recruited Nicholas Negroponte as chairman in 1997. The fees were similar to credit card systems; no cost for purchasers and transaction fees for merchants.</p>
<p>Only one US bank (Mark Twain in Saint Louis) tested an implementation of ecash. In Europe micropayment technologies made more since, since there were fewer credit cards and more cash transactions. In June 1998, ecash became available through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit Suisse in Switzerland</li>
<li>Deutsche Bank in Germany</li>
<li>Bank Austria</li>
<li>Sweden’s Posten AB</li>
<li>Den norske Bank in Norway</li>
<li>Japan’s Nomura Research Institute</li>
<li>Merita Bank/EUnet in Finland</li>
<li>St. George Bank and Advance Bank in Australia</li>
</ul>
<p>Only 5,000 customers were signed up after a three-year trial and the system was dissolved in 1998. DigiCash was unable to grow the company successfully through the expansion of its user base. Chaum stated in an interview in 1999 that the DigiCash project entered the market before e-commerce was fully integrated within the Internet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped; it was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them<br>
-David Chaum (1999)</p>

<h2>eCash Technologies</h2>
<p>Despite the growing e-commerce market, DigiCash declared bankruptcy in 1998 and was subsequently acquired by eCash Technologies.</p>
<p>In 2000, eCash Technologies sued eCash.com on the grounds of trademark infringement through the use of the eCash.com web address. eCash Technologies went bankrupt before the case could reach a verdict, and the domain remained in possession of the original owner. In 2002, the company was sold for assets to InfoSpace.</p>
