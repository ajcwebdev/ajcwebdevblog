<p>Like any technology conceived of and built by humans, [the internet] is shaped by human struggles, by the push and pull of a multitude of interests and schools of thought. What’s needed is a coalition around a New Optimism—one that celebrates what’s working, is honest about what isn’t, and articulates a path forward grounded not so much in technological fixes as in a richer understanding of trust, identity, and community.
-Tim Hwang</p>
<p>Tim Hwang recently coined a new term that hit close to home. The creation of this blog was heavily inspired by my technological apostasy. Tim and I have both observed a growing identification among internet users that he has dubbed the Depressed Former Internet Optimist (DFIO).</p>
<p>The promise and peril of the early internet was heavily debated throughout the 90s and early 2000s. Optimists believed the internet would spark a flourishing of knowledge creation and weaken authoritarian governments. Pessimists saw the internet as the ultimate tool of societal control. Optimists eventually won over many politicians, investors, and journalists. But the converted have been questioning their faith over the last few years. Tim has discerned four categories while specifying that many will relate to multiple labels.</p>
<p>The Purists believe the internet is still fundamentally benevolent and blame the corrupting influence of corporations and surveillance capitalism. They evangelize blockchains, breaking up the big tech firms, and regulating ad tech.
The Disillusioned say that the internet was never that great to begin with. They want to delete their Facebook but worry that doing so will hinder their ability to tell their friends to delete their Facebook.
The Hopefuls highlight the positive trends on the internet such as experiments in digital democracy and the diversity of internet culture.
The Revisionists think that the original aspirations of the web are still relevant and can be achieved with stronger community guidelines, nudging interfaces, and user-centered design.
Tim identifies as a Hopeful-Revisionist. I’d consider myself a primarily a Purist-Revisionist, and a Hopeful fellow traveler. Purists-Revisionists and Hopeful-Revisionists agree that we need some type of internet reform. The debate will concern how it should be reformed. If the internet is in fact broken then we need to ask:</p>
<p>How is it broken?
How broken is it?
Does it need to be reformed or rebuilt?
The reforms that Tim advocates can only be implemented by the corporations that caused this mess in the first place. As long as social networks are financially incentivized for surveillance capitalism they will not drastically alter their platforms.</p>
<p>I understand his frustration with purists that look for technological fixes or government regulation. As I’ve learned more about blockchain technology and gained a more nuanced opinion of its potential I have certainly become more skeptical of its transformative effects.</p>
<p>Even if web3 never fully materializes it has provided a radical framework to debate the issues of trust, identity, and community in a digital world. Exploring drastically new models will help us envision new solutions and pinpoint problems with our current paradigm. The danger with this approach is that these new models could lead to even worse problems than the ones we have now.</p>
<p>My Hopeful side comes from my hunch that the current internet culture at large is driving the campaign to convert Optimists into DFIOs. I salute Tim and hope that the full range of DFIOs can cohere. If DFIOs reach a critical mass the tech companies will have a financial incentive to reform their networks.</p>
<p>The challenge will be achieving this without creating a critical mass of Disillusions that prefer to opt out. If people think Silicon Valley can’t sufficiently reform itself there will be increasing pressure on politicians to legislate.</p>
<p>As computers continue to permeate our homes, cars, businesses, these market failures will no longer be tolerable. Our only solution will be regulation, and that regulation will be foisted on us by a government desperate to “do something” in the face of disaster.</p>
<p>Regulation might be a dirty word in today’s political climate, but security is the exception to our small-government bias. And as the threats posed by computers become greater and more catastrophic, regulation will be inevitable. So now’s the time to start thinking about it.</p>
