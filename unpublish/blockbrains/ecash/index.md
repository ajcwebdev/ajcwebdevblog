In 1983, David Chaum designed ecash as an anonymous cryptographic electronic money.

Blind Signatures
In 1982, Chaum introduced blind signatures, hoping to ensure the complete privacy of users conducting online transactions.

Chaum was concerned with the public nature and open access to online payments and personal information
He proposed a system of cryptographic protocols ensuring untraceable personal payments online

It was used as a micropayment system at one US bank from 1995 to 1998.

Software on the user’s computer stored money in a digital format, cryptographically signed by a bank
The user could spend the digital money at any shop accepting eCash
They would not need to open an account with the vendor first or transmitting credit card numbers
Security was ensured by public key digital signature schemes.

The RSA blind signatures achieved unlinkability between withdrawal and spend transactions
Depending on the payment transactions, one distinguishes between on-line and off-line electronic cash
If the payee has to contact a third party before accepting a payment, the system is called an on-line system
DigiCash required user software that withdrew notes from a bank and then designated specific encrypted keys before sending the money to a recipient. This allowed electronic payments to become untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or a third party This improved security through the issuance of secured keys which prevented third parties from accessing personal information.

DigiCash Inc.
An electronic money corporation founded by Chaum in 1989.

Chaum started the company with “ecash” as its trademark
He raised $10 million from David Marquardt and recruited Nicholas Negroponte as chairman in 1997
The fees were similar to credit card systems; no cost for purchasers and transaction fees for merchants
Only one US bank (Mark Twain in Saint Louis) tested an implementation of ecash. In Europe micropayment technologies made more since, since there were fewer credit cards and more cash transactions. In June 1998, ecash became available through:

Credit Suisse in Switzerland
Deutsche Bank in Germany
Bank Austria
Sweden’s Posten AB
Den norske Bank in Norway
Japan’s Nomura Research Institute
Merita Bank/EUnet in Finland
St. George Bank and Advance Bank in Australia
Only 5,000 customers were signed up after a three-year trial and the system was dissolved in 1998.

DigiCash was unable to grow the company successfully through the expansion of its user base
Chaum stated in an interview in 1999 that the DigiCash project entered the market before e-commerce was fully integrated within the Internet
“As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped; it was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them” -David Chaum (1999)

eCash Technologies
Despite the growing e-commerce market, DigiCash declared bankruptcy in 1998 and was subsequently acquired by eCash Technologies.

In 2000, eCash Technologies sued eCash.com on the grounds of trademark infringement through the use of the eCash.com web address
eCash Technologies went bankrupt before the case could reach a verdict, and the domain remained in possession of the original owner
In 2002, the company was sold for assets to InfoSpace
