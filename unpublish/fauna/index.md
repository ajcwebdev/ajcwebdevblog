[Redwood brings full-stack to the JAMstack (March 12, 2020)](https://changelog.com/jsparty/119)

>In Fauna, the distributed capabilities are amazing. It’s a little challenging to use via FQL so far, but Prisma is working to try to normalize that a little bit. Can you approach it in a more query-builder kind of way and make it approachable? Again, it’s a new technology that you have to learn. But something like Fauna would be perfect if it was relational.

>Doing a serverless database - Fauna is kind of doing it... But it’s very restricted in how it works still. And you can be very cheap, but you can do it; you could make a fully serverless RedwoodJS app, end to end, today, but it’s not gonna scale the way that you want probably… But the beauty is on the database side you choose your database provider, you spin it up… You can get whatever performance you need.

>TPW: The databases are the more difﬁcult part. My ideal database is built from scratch to be distributed, that that's just the core concept of how it works. You’d see things like FaunaDB that are really embracing serverless and embracing this idea, and I'm super excited to see where they go. But it's non-relational, and so it has some limitations because of that.

>JM: Do you have any perspective on why those newer databases are – For the purposes of the average JAMStack application, why are those newer databases any different than Mongo?

>TPW: I am not an expert to say exactly why they would be better.

>JM: I actually think what has happened is somehow Fauna has inserted itself as the JAMStack database. For most people, I don't think it matters.

>TPW: Yeah. Well, I think there're some interesting concepts that they have there and that it was built for distribution from the very beginning and the characteristics that you get from those distributed writes is very powerful. Again, I haven't used a lot of those services directly. My life has been primarily in the relational world and we've made relational databases work extensively... My expertise is limited, but the advantages of having that type of NoSQL storage I think are very powerful, but I’m not going to be an expert to be able to defend or rag upon any speciﬁc distributed NoSQL database at this time.

>JM: Yeah, and I have respect for all those distributed consistent, globally consistent database systems, and I just try to do the differential between them, and I guess I'm not an expert in it.
